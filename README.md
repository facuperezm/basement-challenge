## Final comments

In this challenge, I took on some truly demanding tasks. Building a project from the ground up in just two days is quite a challenge! However, I'm proud of the result I've achieved. I'm aware there's room for improvement, but this is an honest representation of my skills during a challenge in a short period of time. I hope you all enjoy it!
